Dhall is a programmable configuration language optimized for
maintainability.

You can think of Dhall as: JSON + functions + types + imports

Note that while Dhall is programmable, Dhall is not Turing-complete.  Many
of Dhall's features take advantage of this restriction to provide stronger
safety guarantees and more powerful tooling.

You can try the language live in your browser by visiting the official website:

# `dhall-python`

`dhall-python` contains [Dhall][dhall-lang] bindings for Python using the 
[rust][dhall-rust] implementation. It is meant to be used to integrate Dhall 
into your python applications.

If you only want to convert Dhall to/from JSON or YAML, you should use the
official tooling instead; instructions can be found
[here](https://docs.dhall-lang.org/tutorials/Getting-started_Generate-JSON-or-YAML.html).

## Usage

Install using pip:

```shell
pip install dhall
```

Supports the following:

- Operating Systems
  - Windows
  - Mac OS
  - Linux (with libssl.so.1 and libcrypto.so.1)
- Python versions
  - 3.6
  - 3.7
  - 3.8
  - 3.9

dhall-python implements a similar API to Python's [json
module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html):

```python
>>> import dhall
>>> dhall.dumps({"keyA": 81, "keyB": True, "keyC": "value"})
'{ keyA = 81, keyB = True, keyC = "value" }'
>>> dhall.loads("""{ keyA = 81, keyB = True, keyC = "value" }""")
{'keyA': 81, 'keyB': True, 'keyC': 'value'}
```

# Developer guide

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for managing the development environment. If you don't have it installed, run

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
export PATH="$HOME/.poetry/bin:$PATH"
```

The project requires the latest `stable` version of Rust.

Install it via `rustup`:

```
rustup install stable
```

If you have already installed the `stable` version, make sure it is up-to-date:

```
rustup update stable
```

After that, you can compile the current version of dhall-python and execute all tests and benchmarks with the following commands:

```
make install
make test
```

🤫 Pssst!... run `make help` to learn more.
